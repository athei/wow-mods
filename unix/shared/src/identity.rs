//! Who this binary is: which release it was built from, and which exact image it is.
//!
//! [`BUILD`] is the release identity, stamped in by `build.rs` from `git
//! describe`. It says which source a build came from, but two builds of the
//! same source share it.
//!
//! [`image_id`] is the binary identity: the ID the linker itself assigned to
//! this image, read back out of the loaded image at runtime. Both `lld-link`
//! and `ld64` derive it from the output's contents, so it changes whenever the
//! binary does and is stable across a reproducible rebuild. It is also the key
//! the symbol tools pair on (the PDB's GUID, the `.dSYM`'s UUID), so one value
//! both names the build and selects the file that symbolicates it.
//!
//! Every shipped DLL and the `.so` log both on load. A crash report then names
//! the debug archive that resolves it, instead of leaving us to fingerprint the
//! build from indirect evidence.

/// Release identity, stamped by `build.rs` from `git describe --tags --always`.

/// `v1.3.1` on a release tag, `v1.3.1-1-g6e34197` between tags, and the
